## The Sensitivity Analysis For Everybody (SAFE) Toolbox ##

The SAFE Toolbox provides a set of functions to perform Global Sensitivity Analysis. 
It implements several methods, including the Elementary Effects Test, Regional Sensitivity Analysis,
Variance-Based (Sobolâ€™) sensitivity analysis and the PAWN method. <br>
SAFE was originally developed for the Matlab/Octave environment (Pianosi et al 2015) 
but is now available also in R and Python. An overview of the community of SAFE users 
and their evaluation of SAFE can be found in Pianosi et al (2020).

### Download ###

The SAFE Toolbox is available on GitHub in three versions:
* [Matlab version](https://github.com/SAFEtoolbox/SAFEtoolbox/tree/master/SAFE-matlab/)
* [Python version](https://github.com/SAFEtoolbox/SAFEtoolbox/tree/master/SAFE-python/)
* [R version](https://github.com/SAFEtoolbox/SAFEtoolbox/tree/master/SAFE-R/)

Use SAFE freely but please cite the paper [Pianosi et al. 2015](/index#references) in any publication
presenting results obtained using SAFE.

### Contributors ###

SAFE was originally developed in Matlab by Francesca Pianosi, Fanny Sarrazin and Thorsten Wagener 
at the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Bristol. The R version was developed
by Isabella Gollini and Valentina Noacco. The Python Jupyter Notebooks were developed by
Andres Penuela-Fernandez.
