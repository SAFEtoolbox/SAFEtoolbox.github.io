Since 2015 we have run many training courses on Global Sensitivity Analysis 
and the SAFE Toolbox in different formats (1 hour, half-day, 1 day)
and for different audiences, including the [Young Hydrologic Society](https://younghs.com/2019/05/03/hydroinformatics-for-hydrology-uncertainty-analysis/) and the [EGU Generaly Assembly](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/39658).
If you are interested in getting a training course about GSA/SAFE, please get in touch
with Francesca Pianosi. Otherwise on this page you can find several training materials.
