The SAFE Toolbox

## Scientific and Technical Documentation 

TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

A general introduction to the rationale and architecture of SAFE is given in:

Pianosi, F., Sarrazin, F., Wagener, T. (2015), A Matlab toolbox for Global Sensitivity Analysis, Environmental Modelling & Software, 70, 80-85. (Open Access)

Detailed documentation on how to use the toolbox is given in the workflow scripts provided with the Toolbox and in the help of each function.

### Why using GSA

For an introduction on what is Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) and what it is GSA for, see: <br>
[Wagener, T. & Pianosi, F. (2019), What has Global Sensitivity Analysis ever done for us? 
A systematic review to support scientific advancement and to inform policy-making in earth 
system modelling, Earth-Science Reviews, 149, 1-18.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218300990) <br>
This paper provides a literature review of GSA applications in the context of earth systems modelling, 
focusing on what can be learnt about the construction, testing and use of environmental
models through the application of GSA. This paper could be a useful starting point
to explore the type of questions GSA can address, and why using GSA in the first place

For a more playful introduction to the benefits of using GSA, try one of our
interactive Jupyter Notebooks (these interactive examples can be run from the browser):

* Using GSA to identify the most influential model parameters: application to a hydrological model

### How to

A general introduction on the key choices in setting-up a Global Sensitivity Analysis 
(how to choose the GSA method, the sampling strategy, the sample size, etc.)
with references for further reading is given in: <br>
[Pianosi, F., Beven, K., Freer, J.W. Hall, J. Rougier, J. Stephenson, D.B., Wagener, T. (2016),

Environmental Modelling & Software, 79, 214-232.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216300287)

More discussion on the practical effects of some of the key set-up choices,
and how to interpret them, is given in:
