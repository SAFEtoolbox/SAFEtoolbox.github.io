## Scientific and Technical Documentation 

### How to use SAFE

A general introduction to the rationale and architecture of SAFE is given in:<br>
[Pianosi, F., Sarrazin, F., Wagener, T. (2015), A Matlab toolbox for Global Sensitivity Analysis, 
Environmental Modelling & Software, 70, 80-85.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001188)
Detailed documentation on how to use the toolbox is given in the workflow scripts 
provided with the Toolbox and in the help of each function.

### Why doing GSA

A **literature review** of GSA applications in the context of earth systems modelling, 
focusing on what can be learnt about the construction, testing and use of environmental
models through the application of GSA. <br>
[Wagener, T. & Pianosi, F. (2019), What has Global Sensitivity Analysis ever done for us? 
A systematic review to support scientific advancement and to inform policy-making in earth 
system modelling, Earth-Science Reviews, 149, 1-18.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825218300990) <br>
This paper could be a useful starting point to explore the type of questions GSA can address, and why using GSA in the first place

A set of **interactive Jupyter Notebooks** for a more playful introduction to the benefits of using GSA
(the notebooks can be run from the browser):
* [Using GSA to enhance model-informed decisions: application example to a flu model](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AndresPenuela/SAFE-Notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=tree/GSA_flu_model.ipynb)
* [Using GSA to identify the most influential model parameters: application to a hydrological model](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AndresPenuela/SAFE-Notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=tree/GSA_hydrological_model.ipynb)
* [Using GSA to find the key controls of a system: an ecological model example](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AndresPenuela/SAFE-Notebooks/HEAD?urlpath=tree/GSA_predator_prey_model.ipynb)

A discussion about the connection between **GSA and model evaluation** particularly for impacts assessment under change:
[Wagener, T., Reinecke R., Pianosi, F. (2022) On the evaluation of climate change impact models, WIREs Climate Change, 13(3), e772](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wcc.772)

### How to do GSA

A general introduction to the working principles of Global Sensitivity Analysis 
and how to make key set-up choices (how to choose the GSA method, the sampling strategy, 
the sample size, etc.) is given in: <br>
[Pianosi, F., Beven, K., Freer, J.W. Hall, J. Rougier, J. Stephenson, D.B., Wagener, T. (2016), 
Sensitivity analysis of environmental models: A systematic review with practical workflow, 
Environmental Modelling & Software, 79, 214-232.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216300287)

More discussion on the practical effects of some of the key set-up choices,
and how to interpret them, is given in:<br>
[Noacco, V., Sarrazin, F., Pianosi, F. and Wagener, T. (2019), 
Matlab/R workflows to assess critical choices in Global Sensitivity Analysis 
using the SAFE toolbox, MethodX, 6, 2258-2280.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016119302572)

Specific discussion on the choice of the sample size for EET, RSA and VBSA can be found in:<br>
[Sarrazin, F., Pianosi, F., Wagener, T. (2016), Sensitivity analysis of environmental 
models: Convergence and validation Environmental Modelling & Software, 79, 135-152.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815216300251)
